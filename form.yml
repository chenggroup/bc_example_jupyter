      The type and number of GPU cards to request for the job.
      If you do not need a GPU card, just leave this field to `none`.

      You don't need to specify the GPU type on `gpu1` and `gpu3`, just fill in the number of cards you need.
      For example, `1`, `2`, ...

      On `gpu2`, however, you need to specify the GPU type:count accordingly. For example,
      `1g.10gb:1`, `a100:1`

    value: "none"
